STL Containers: Explain the concept of iterators in the context of the standard template library STL in C++. Provide an example code snippet demonstrating the use of iterators with a specific STL container, and discuss the advantages of using iterators. 


- Uniform interfaces; iterators provide a consistent way to access elements across different STL containers. 

Iterators are a fundamental concept in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). 

They provide a way to access elements of a container (like vectors, lists, maps, etc.) in a sequential manner without exposing the underlying representation of the container. Iterators are similar to pointers in that they can be used to traverse the elements of a container.

Key Features of Iterators:
- Abstraction: They abstract the details of the container, allowing you to write generic code that works with any container type.
- Flexibility: Iterators can be used to traverse containers in different ways (forward, backward, random access).
- Consistency: They provide a consistent interface for accessing elements, regardless of the container type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Create a vector of integers
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Use an iterator to traverse the vector
    std::cout << "Vector elements: ";
    for (std::vector<int>::iterator it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << " ";  // Dereference the iterator to access the element
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Using a const_iterator for read-only access
    std::cout << "Read-only access: ";
    for (std::vector<int>::const_iterator it = numbers.cbegin(); it != numbers.cend(); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Generic Programming: Iterators allow you to write algorithms that work with any container type, enhancing code reusability.
Encapsulation: They hide the details of the container's implementation, providing a clean interface for element access.
Flexibility: Iterators can be used to perform complex operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal in a consistent manner.
Safety: They provide bounds checking in debug mode, reducing the risk of accessing invalid memory.
