# Question 2

**Q**: What are the main differences between an array and a C++ vector?

**A**: 

In C++, an array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. It is allocated on the stack and its size must be known at compile time.

A vector, on the other hand, is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink at runtime. It is allocated on the heap and its size can be changed.
