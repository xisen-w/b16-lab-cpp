The getForce() function returns the force of the mass, which affects the acceleration and hence the velocity of the mass. The mass's position is then updated by the velocity and the acceleration. 

The update() function updates the mass's position and velocity based on the force applied to it. 

The World class contains two vectors, one for masses and one for springs. The addMass() function adds a mass to the masses vector, and the addSpring() function adds a spring to the springs vector. The update() function updates the entire system for one time step, by calculating and applying forces to masses. The destructor cleans up allocated memory for masses and springs.
